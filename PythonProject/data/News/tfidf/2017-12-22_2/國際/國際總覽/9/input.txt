Pushing   OnJustin   Skeesuck   and   Patrick   Gray   have   been   best   friends   since   childhood .   They   always   played   outside   and   went   exploring   together   when   they   were   young .   As   they   grew   up ,   they   went   to   different   universities   but   managed   to   stay   close . 
 When   he   was   in   his   30s ,   Skeesuck   got   a   disease   that   left   him   unable   to   use   his   muscles ,   and   he   had   to   be   in   a   wheelchair .   The   two   friends   didn ' t   want   this   to   stop   them   from   living   life   to   the   fullest ,   so   they   decided   to   hike   500   miles   through   Spain .
